## Description

This application has been created as a workout tracker, allowing you to create and track daily workouts. Users are able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. Users can track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, users can track my distance traveled.

Mongo has been used for the database and the application has been deployed on Heroku.
